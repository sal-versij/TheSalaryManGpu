Enumeration (E)
- Cached (ch)
  - vertex (v)
    - int vertex (i)
    - char vertex (c)
  - i/o buffers (iob)
    - recreate  (r)
    - create once (c)
      - write (w)
      - map (m)
  - cost buffer (cb)
    - read (r)
    - unmap (u)
- Procedural
  - One output per work-item (1i1o)
  - Sliding Window (sw)
Adjacency Matrix (AM)
- Global Array (ga)
- Local Array (la)
Cost Array (CA)
- single result (sr)
- partial results (pr)
Min Cost (MC)
- on cpu (cpu)
- on gpu (gpu)

Executables:
1. Cached enumeration of integer vertices loaded via recreated i/o buffers with global array adjacency matrix and single result cost array copied to host device for min cost computation on CPU
   1. Cached enumeration of char vertices loaded via recreated i/o buffers with global array adjacency matrix and single result cost array mapped to host device for min cost computation on CPU
      1. Cached enumeration of char vertices loaded via created once i/o buffers copied to device with global array adjacency matrix and single result cost array mapped to host device for min cost computation on CPU
      2. Cached enumeration of char vertices loaded via created once i/o buffers mapped to device with global array adjacency matrix and single result cost array mapped to host device for min cost computation on CPU
   2. Cached enumeration of char vertices loaded via recreated i/o buffers with local array adjacency matrix and single result cost array mapped to host device for min cost computation on CPU
      1. Reorder partitions array to get contguous memory access
